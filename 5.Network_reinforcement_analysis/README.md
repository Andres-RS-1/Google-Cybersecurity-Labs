You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which has compromised the security of its customers' personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be carried out consistently to prevent future attacks and breaches.

After inspecting the organization's network, you discover four significant vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are the following:

Employees of the organization share passwords.

The database administrator password is the default.

Firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic entering and leaving the network.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not used.

If steps are not taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future.

In this activity, you will write a security risk assessment to analyze the incident and explain what methods can be used to further protect the network.
