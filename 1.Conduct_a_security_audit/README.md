This scenario is based on a fictitious company:

Botium Toys is a small American company that develops and sells toys. The company has a single physical headquarters. However, its online presence has grown, attracting customers from the United States and abroad. Your information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support your worldwide online marketplace.

The manager of the IT department has decided that it is necessary to conduct an internal IT audit. She expresses concern about not having a consolidated action plan to ensure business continuity and regulatory compliance as the company grows. She believes that an internal audit can help better secure a company's infrastructure and help identify and mitigate potential risks, threats or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (EU).

The IT manager begins by applying the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), establishing an audit scope and objectives, and completing a risk assessment. The objective of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks that the company could experience due to the current state of its security posture. The IT manager wants to use the audit results as evidence to obtain approval to expand her department.

Your task is to review the IT manager's scope, objectives, and risk assessment. She then performs an internal audit to complete an assessment of controls and a compliance checklist.
