Review the following scenario. Then, complete the instructions step by step.

You work as a security analyst for a travel agency advertising sales and promotions on the company's website. Company employees regularly access the company's sales website to search for vacation packages that their customers might like.

One afternoon, you receive an automated alert from your monitoring system indicating a problem with the web server. You try to visit the company's website, but you receive a connection timeout error message in your browser.

You use a packet sniffer to capture data packets in transit to and from the web server. You notice a large number of TCP SYN requests coming from an unknown IP address. The web server appears to be overwhelmed by the volume of incoming traffic and is losing its ability to respond to the abnormally large number of SYN requests. You suspect that the server is being attacked by a malicious actor.

You temporarily disconnect the server so that the computer can recover and return to a normal operating state. You also configure the company's firewall to block the IP address that was sending the abnormal number of SYN requests. You know that your IP blocking solution won't last long, as an attacker can spoof other IP addresses to bypass this blocking. You need to alert your manager about this issue quickly and discuss next steps to stop this attacker and prevent this issue from happening again. You'll need to be prepared to tell your boss what type of attack you discovered and how it was affecting the web server and employees.
