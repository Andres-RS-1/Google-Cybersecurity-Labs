You are a cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions for small businesses. Your organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved.

During the attack, your organization's network services suddenly stopped responding due to a flood of incoming ICMP packets. Normal internal network traffic was unable to access any network resources. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services.

The company's cybersecurity team then investigated the security incident. They discovered that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings to the company's network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company's network via a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.

To address this security issue, the network security team implemented:

A new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets.

Checking the source IP address on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses in incoming ICMP packets.

A network monitoring software to detect anomalous traffic patterns.

An IDS/IPS system to filter some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics.

As a cybersecurity analyst, you are tasked with using this security event to create a plan to improve your company's network security, following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). You will use the CSF to help you navigate the different steps of analyzing this cybersecurity incident and integrate your analysis into an overall security strategy:

Identify security risks through regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential security gaps.

Protect internal assets by applying policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats.

Detect potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections.

Respond to contain, neutralize and analyze security incidents; implement improvements in the security process.

Recover normal operation of affected systems and restore data and/or assets of systems that have been affected by an incident.
